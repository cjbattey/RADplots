RADplots
========

R Functions for plotting data generated by RAD sequencing - mostly dealing with the output from pyRAD

structurePlot.R is probably the only one of these that's ready for general use. ggstruct.R does the same thing worse, so I'd go with structurePlot. If you love ggplot, ggstruct and structurePlot could be merged without too much difficulty - fork away!

If you use anything in here and run into errors, plz send me an email and I'll see what I can do. Same deal with requests on new structure plotting functionality.
